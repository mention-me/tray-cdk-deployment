  # We're using the "bump-*" labelling for PRs, as Dependabot uses "major", "minor" and "patch" labels (when
  # they exist in the repository) to denote a major/minor/patch bump in a dependency. And, generally speaking,
  # just because dependencies are major bump, does not mean our release notes NEED to be major releases.
